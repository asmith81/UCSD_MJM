## Executive Summary

This capstone project addresses a critical business challenge facing construction contractors: the manual processing of subcontractor invoices. Working with a Washington D.C. area general contracting firm, this project develops and evaluates an automated OCR solution using modern multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract structured data from handwritten and printed construction invoices.

**Business Problem:** The contractor currently processes 797+ invoices manually, requiring significant time investment and introducing potential transcription errors. Invoices are submitted as photographs via Google Forms, with critical data fields (work order numbers, addresses, costs) requiring manual extraction.

**Technical Approach:** This project implements and compares three distinct approaches:
- **DocTR**: Traditional OCR with deep learning
- **LLaMA Vision**: Self-attention multimodal architecture  
- **Pixtral**: Cross-attention multimodal architecture

**Key Findings:** LLaMA Vision with step-by-step prompting achieved the highest accuracy for numeric field extraction, while Pixtral provided the most consistent results with superior computational efficiency. The study demonstrates that modern multimodal LLMs significantly outperform traditional OCR approaches for complex document understanding tasks.

**Impact:** The solution offers quantifiable business value through reduced labor costs, improved accuracy, and enables skilled staff to focus on higher-value tasks. The dual deployment strategy (local vs. cloud) provides flexibility for contractors with varying infrastructure capabilities.
