# Discussion of Scaling - Construction Invoice Processing System

## Executive Summary

The construction invoice processing system discussed in this study operates in a relatively low-volume environment, processing approximately 5 invoices per day. This operational context significantly influences the scaling strategy and infrastructure requirements compared to high-volume enterprise document processing systems. The scaling discussion addresses both the immediate deployment needs for the current volume and the architectural considerations for potential future enterprise-level scaling.

## Current Volume Analysis

### 1.1 Processing Volume Characteristics

**Current State:**
- **Daily Volume: ~5 invoices per day**
- **Monthly Volume: ~150 invoices per month**
- **Annual Volume: ~1,800 invoices per year**
- **Peak Processing: Likely concentrated during business hours**

**Volume Implications:**
- **Low urgency for real-time processing** - invoices can be processed in batch
- **Minimal infrastructure requirements** for current volume
- **Cost optimization opportunities** through scheduled processing
- **Quality over speed priority** - accuracy more important than processing latency

### 1.2 Processing Time Context

Based on the experimental results from the performance analysis:

**Model Processing Times:**
- **Llama-step_by_step:** 5.82 seconds per invoice (highest accuracy: 84%)
- **Pixtral models:** ~1.5 seconds per invoice (good accuracy: ~77%)
- **DocTR models:** ~0.6 seconds per invoice (poor accuracy: ~45%)

**Daily Processing Requirements:**
- **Using Llama:** 5 invoices × 5.82s = ~29 seconds total processing time
- **Using Pixtral:** 5 invoices × 1.5s = ~7.5 seconds total processing time
- **Buffer for processing:** Even with 10x safety margin, less than 5 minutes daily

## Scaling Strategy for Current Volume

### 2.1 Batch Processing Architecture

**Recommended Approach: Asynchronous Batch Processing**

Given the low volume requirements, **synchronous processing is not necessary**. The system can efficiently operate using:

**Queue-Based Processing:**
- **Invoice ingestion** during business hours
- **Scheduled batch processing** during off-peak hours (overnight/early morning)
- **Results delivery** before business day begins
- **Manual review integration** for quality assurance

**Processing Schedule Options:**
1. **Nightly Batch Processing** (Recommended)
   - Collect invoices throughout the day
   - Process entire queue overnight (11 PM - 6 AM)
   - Results available by morning business hours
   
2. **Multi-Daily Processing**
   - Process queue 2-3 times per day
   - Mid-day and end-of-day processing
   - Faster turnaround for urgent invoices

3. **On-Demand Triggered Processing**
   - Process when queue reaches threshold (e.g., 5 invoices)
   - Manual trigger for urgent processing
   - Flexible timing based on business needs

### 2.2 Infrastructure Requirements for Current Scale

**Deployment Options for Low Volume Processing:**

Given the minimal processing requirements (~5 invoices/day), multiple deployment strategies are viable:

#### **Option 1: Local/On-Premises Deployment**
**Recommended for:** Maximum cost control and data security

**Hardware Requirements:**
- **Local server or workstation** with 8GB+ RAM, 4+ CPU cores

#### **Hybrid Approach**
**Recommended for:** Gradual migration strategy

**Phase 1: Local Development**
- **Start with local deployment** for testing and initial implementation
- **Validate processing accuracy** and workflow integration
- **Train staff** on system operation

**Phase 2: Small Cloud Migration**
- **Move to Digital Ocean** or similar for operational reliability
