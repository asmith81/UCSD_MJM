## Phase 1: Environment Setup & API Integration

### Windows Development Challenges
The project began with significant Windows-specific development challenges that provided valuable learning experiences:

**Package Installation Issues**: 
- Encountered compilation failures for scientific Python packages (numpy, pandas, Pillow, scikit-image) on Windows
- **Solution Implemented**: Enhanced `install_requirements()` function with:
  - Automatic pip upgrading
  - Windows-specific compilation handling (`--only-binary=all`, `--no-build-isolation`)
  - Individual package testing with detailed error reporting
  - Encoding issue resolution for subprocess operations

**CSV Corruption Recovery**:
- Discovered that interrupted operations created corrupted/empty CSV files
- **Solution Implemented**: Robust CSV handling with automatic detection and recovery
- Added comprehensive error handling for `EmptyDataError` and `ParserError` exceptions

### Google API Integration Success
Successfully implemented comprehensive Google Drive and Sheets integration:

## Phase 3: Strategic Curation Decision

### Critical Decision Point: Automated vs Manual Processing
After successful download completion, we reached a strategic decision point regarding image processing approach.

**Original Plan**: Automated image adjustments (brightness, contrast, color correction) with user-guided processing
**Decision**: Transition to manual curation approach

### Rationale for Manual Curation
1. **Quality Assurance**: Manual selection ensures highest quality results for business-critical image dataset
2. **Time to Value**: Faster path to production-ready curated dataset
3. **Substantial Dataset**: 549 images provide ample material for selective curation
4. **Business Focus**: Prioritizes business-critical curation workflow over technical automation
5. **Resource Optimization**: Concentrates development effort on high-impact features

### Curation Results Achieved
- **Final Curated Dataset**: 52 high-quality images selected from 549 total
- **Selection Criteria**: Image clarity, text legibility, representative invoice formats
- **Business Value**: Focus on construction invoice formats most relevant to target use case
- **Quality Assurance**: Manual review ensured optimal conditions for model evaluation

## Phase 4: Model Selection & Implementation

### Vision-Language Models (LMMs) Selected

- **Format**: `results-{model_name}-{quant_level}-{id_number}.json`
- **Examples**: `results-pixtral-bfloat16-1.json`, `results-llama-torch_dtype-2.json`, `results-doctr-none-3.json`
- **Benefits**: Clear identification, chronological ordering, collision prevention, analysis-friendly structure

### Comprehensive Prompt Engineering Strategy
Implemented four distinct prompting approaches for systematic comparison:

1. **Basic Extraction**: Simple field identification and JSON output
2. **Detailed Instructions**: Comprehensive guidance with specific formatting requirements
3. **Locational Prompting**: Spatial awareness instructions for invoice layout
4. **Step-by-Step**: Structured reasoning approach with explicit process steps

### Experimental Execution Results

### Vision-Language vs Traditional OCR Comparison

**Fundamental Performance Gap Discovered**:

**OCR (DocTR) Baseline Performance**:
- **Approach**: Traditional two-stage OCR pipeline (text detection + recognition)
- **Text Detection**: Multiple detection models tested (db_resnet50, db_mobilenet_v3_large, linknet_resnet variants)  
- **Text Recognition**: Multiple recognition models tested (crnn_vgg16_bn, crnn_mobilenet variants, vitstr, master, sar_resnet31)
- **Processing Method**: Extract all text, rely on post-processing to identify relevant fields
- **Key Limitation**: No semantic understanding of document structure or field relationships

**Vision-Language Models (Pixtral/Llama) Performance**:
- **Approach**: End-to-end semantic understanding with direct field extraction
- **Processing Method**: Understand document context and extract specific fields through natural language reasoning
- **Key Advantage**: Inherent understanding of invoice structure and field semantics

**Critical Insight**: **Vision-Language Models fundamentally outperform traditional OCR** for structured document processing by incorporating semantic understanding rather than relying solely on character recognition.

### Error Pattern Analysis
**Systematic Error Categories Identified**:
- **Date Confusion**: 15% of work order errors (mixing work orders with invoice dates)
- **Decimal Insertion**: 10% of work order errors (adding spurious decimal points)
- **Field Misidentification**: 20% of work order errors (extracting addresses, company names)
- **Amount Discrepancies**: Minor $6 differences on specific invoices for total costs

## Phase 7: Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Major Technical Challenge: Quantization Implementation
**Problem Encountered**: Persistent `RuntimeError: Input type (torch.cuda.FloatTensor) and weight type (torch.cuda.HalfTensor) should be the same`

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Model processors create inputs in `float32` by default
- BitsAndBytesConfig quantization converts weights to `float16`
- Vision layers receive mismatched dtypes causing convolution failures

**Solutions Attempted**:
1. **Quantization Configuration Fixes**: Eliminated initial `cublasLt` errors but dtype mismatch persisted
2. **Smart Dtype Detection**: Improved reliability but inconsistent across quantization scenarios
3. **Fallback Logic**: Still encountered edge cases with complex multi-modal architectures

**Strategic Decision Made**: 
- **Removed quantization options** from experimental scope
- **Adopted bfloat16 precision only** for reliable inference
- **Documented as future work** requiring dedicated investigation time
