### Phase 3: Strategic Decision - Manual Curation Approach

#### Critical Decision Point: Automated vs Manual Processing
After successful download completion, we reached a strategic decision point regarding image processing approach.

**Original Plan**: Automated image adjustments (brightness, contrast, color correction) with user-guided processing
**Decision**: Transition to manual curation approach

#### Rationale for Manual Curation
1. **Quality Assurance**: Manual selection ensures highest quality results for business-critical image dataset
2. **Time to Value**: Faster path to production-ready curated dataset
3. **Substantial Dataset**: 549 images provide ample material for selective curation
4. **Business Focus**: Prioritizes business-critical curation workflow over technical automation
5. **Resource Optimization**: Concentrates development effort on high-impact features

#### Benefits of This Approach
- **Higher Quality Outcomes**: Human judgment for image quality assessment
- **Faster Implementation**: Avoids complex automated adjustment algorithms
- **Better Business Alignment**: Direct control over final dataset composition
- **Clearer Success Metrics**: Concrete goal of 100-150 curated high-quality images

- **Amount Discrepancies**: Minor $6 differences on specific invoices for total costs

#### Traditional OCR vs Vision-Language Model Comparison
**Fundamental Performance Gap Discovered**:

**OCR (DocTR) Baseline Performance**:
- **Approach**: Traditional two-stage OCR pipeline (text detection + recognition)
- **Text Detection**: Multiple detection models tested (db_resnet50, db_mobilenet_v3_large, linknet_resnet variants)  
- **Text Recognition**: Multiple recognition models tested (crnn_vgg16_bn, crnn_mobilenet variants, vitstr, master, sar_resnet31)
- **Processing Method**: Extract all text, rely on post-processing to identify relevant fields
- **Key Limitation**: No semantic understanding of document structure or field relationships

**Vision-Language Models (Pixtral/Llama) Performance**:
- **Approach**: End-to-end semantic understanding with direct field extraction
- **Processing Method**: Understand document context and extract specific fields through natural language reasoning
- **Key Advantage**: Inherent understanding of invoice structure and field semantics

**Performance Comparison Results**:
- **LMM Advantage**: 94% total cost accuracy (Llama) vs traditional OCR approach requiring extensive post-processing
- **Semantic Understanding**: LMMs correctly identify fields in context vs OCR extracting all text indiscriminately  
- **Error Recovery**: LMMs can reason about ambiguous text vs OCR requiring perfect character recognition
- **Implementation Complexity**: LMMs provide direct structured output vs OCR requiring complex rule-based post-processing

**Critical Insight**: **Vision-Language Models fundamentally outperform traditional OCR** for structured document processing by incorporating semantic understanding rather than relying solely on character recognition.

### Phase 7: Technical Challenges and Solutions (Completed)

#### Major Technical Challenge: Quantization Implementation
**Problem Encountered**: Persistent `RuntimeError: Input type (torch.cuda.FloatTensor) and weight type (torch.cuda.HalfTensor) should be the same`

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Model processors create inputs in `float32` by default
- BitsAndBytesConfig quantization converts weights to `float16`
- Vision layers receive mismatched dtypes causing convolution failures

**Solutions Attempted**:
1. **Quantization Configuration Fixes**: Eliminated initial `cublasLt` errors but dtype mismatch persisted
2. **Smart Dtype Detection**: Improved reliability but inconsistent across quantization scenarios
3. **Fallback Logic**: Still encountered edge cases with complex multi-modal architectures

**Strategic Decision Made**: 
- **Removed quantization options** from experimental scope
- **Adopted bfloat16 precision only** for reliable inference
- **Documented as future work** requiring dedicated investigation time
- **Impact**: Higher memory usage (23GB vs 12GB) but significantly improved stability

#### Data Management and Analysis Pipeline
