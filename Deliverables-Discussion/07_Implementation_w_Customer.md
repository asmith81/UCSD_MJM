# Deployment Discussion Update - Customer Implementation Strategy

## Executive Summary

Following detailed discussions with the customer (general contracting firm), the implementation strategy has evolved significantly from the original academic project design. Rather than building a custom Llama model deployment, the focus has shifted toward leveraging existing commercial OCR solutions integrated into a comprehensive workflow management system. This approach prioritizes rapid deployment, reduced technical risk, and immediate business value while establishing a foundation for broader operational improvements.

The customer currently manages their subcontractor invoice workflow through a complex series of Google Sheets and manual processes. This implementation will systematically replace these systems with an integrated database-driven workflow that maintains human oversight at critical decision points while automating repetitive tasks.

## Strategic Shift: Commercial OCR vs. Custom Model Development

The original academic approach centered on developing and deploying a custom Llama model with local infrastructure. While technically interesting, customer discussions revealed that this approach introduces unnecessary complexity and risk for a business-critical process. Commercial OCR solutions offer proven accuracy, immediate availability, and professional support that align better with operational requirements.

Claude Vision API has emerged as the preferred solution over alternatives like AWS Textract due to its unified interface and superior handling of multilingual handwritten content. Unlike Textract, which requires Lambda functions, preprocessing pipelines, and multiple AWS service integrations, Claude provides a single API endpoint that can be directly integrated into n8n workflows. This simplicity extends to maintenance and tuning, where prompt engineering allows real-time adjustments without code deployment cycles.

Cost analysis shows Claude to be competitive with Textract for the customer's volume of 100-200 invoices monthly, with processing costs ranging from $0.05-0.20 per invoice. More importantly, the operational savings from simplified integration and maintenance outweigh any marginal cost differences between OCR providers.

## Current State Analysis and Target Database Architecture

### Current Workflow: Manual Spreadsheet Dependencies

The existing process relies on multiple disconnected Google Sheets with extensive manual data duplication:

**Current Workflow Steps:**
1. **Work Order Creation**: Basic job information entered into Google Sheet #1 (Jobs)
2. **Assignment Process**: Sheet #1 duplicated to Sheet #2, foreman manually adds subcontractor assignments
3. **Subcontractor Access**: Filtered views or separate sheets created for each subcontractor
4. **Invoice Submission**: Workers fill Google Form with handwritten invoice photos
5. **Data Aggregation**: Form responses automatically populate Sheet #3, with automated copying of project data from Sheet #1
6. **Invoice Review**: Supervisor manually reviews Sheet #3, comparing invoice costs to project descriptions, marks "approved"
7. **Payment Processing**: Bookkeeper manually reviews invoice images against Sheet #3 data, groups by subcontractor and pay period, creates an additional local sheet for payment records, then manually enters in QuickBooks to generate checks
8. **Record Keeping**: Manual status updates across multiple sheets

**Critical Pain Points:**
- **Multiple disconnected data sources**: At least 4 different spreadsheets with no automated synchronization
- **Manual data duplication**: Project information copied between Sheet #1 and Sheet #3
- **Time-intensive image review**: Bookkeeper must manually verify invoice images against transcribed data
- **No duplicate detection**: Same invoices can be processed multiple times
- **Limited audit trail**: No tracking of who made changes or when
- **Error-prone manual processes**: Transcription errors and inconsistent data entry

### Target State: Unified Database Architecture

The target system replaces each Google Sheet with a corresponding SQL table, eliminating data duplication and enabling real-time synchronization:

**Sheet #1 → Jobs Table**: Central repository for all work orders with automatic numbering and job tracking
**Sheet #2 → Assignments Table**: Links jobs to subcontractors with assignment history and notifications  
**Sheet #3 → Invoices Table**: Stores OCR-extracted invoice data with confidence scores and validation flags
**New → Payments Table**: Aggregates approved invoices by subcontractor and pay period for batch processing

### Human Interaction Automation Strategy

Each current manual process will be replaced with local or hosted Python scripts that maintain human oversight while automating routine tasks:

**Current Manual Job Creation → Automated Job Entry Script**
- Local Python interface for creating work orders with automatic numbering
- Integration with client databases for automated job imports
- Validation and duplicate detection

**Current Manual Assignment Process → Assignment Management Script**  
- Local interface for foremen to review available jobs and assign subcontractors
- Automated notifications to assigned workers
- Capacity tracking and workload balancing

**Current Manual Invoice Review → Enhanced Review Dashboard**
- Local Python application displaying OCR-extracted data alongside invoice images
- Confidence scoring to prioritize manual review
- One-click approval with supervisor authentication

**Current Manual Payment Processing → Automated Payment Pipeline**
- Local script for bookkeepers to review aggregated invoices by subcontractor
- Automated QuickBooks integration for vendor bill creation
- Batch payment processing with status updates across all systems

## Technical Architecture Benefits

The Claude Vision API approach provides several operational advantages that extend beyond simple cost comparisons. The unified API interface eliminates the complexity of managing Lambda functions, API Gateway configurations, and multiple AWS service integrations that would be required with Textract.

Prompt engineering enables rapid adaptation to changing invoice formats or new data requirements without code deployment cycles. When the customer encounters new subcontractor invoice styles or needs to extract additional fields, adjustments can be made through prompt modifications rather than model retraining or code changes.

The n8n visual workflow interface provides transparency into the processing pipeline that technical and non-technical stakeholders can understand. Error handling, retry logic, and data validation rules are visible in the workflow design, making troubleshooting and optimization more accessible.

## Risk Management and Migration Strategy

The phased implementation approach minimizes business disruption by maintaining parallel systems during transition periods. Google Sheets remain functional throughout the migration, ensuring business continuity if technical issues arise.

Data backup and recovery procedures protect against both technical failures and user errors. The system maintains audit trails for all data modifications and provides rollback capabilities for critical operations.

Change management includes comprehensive user training, documentation, and ongoing support during the transition period. The familiar interfaces for key stakeholders (Google Sheets for supervisors, desktop applications for bookkeepers) ease adoption while providing enhanced functionality.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

This implementation strategy systematically replaces manual spreadsheet processes with an integrated database system while maintaining human oversight at critical decision points. The phased approach delivers immediate value through OCR automation while building toward a comprehensive job management platform.

Each phase eliminates specific manual processes and data duplication points, creating a more reliable and scalable system. The database-driven architecture provides a foundation for advanced features like analytics, mobile applications, and predictive capabilities.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Customer approval of implementation plan and timeline
2. Supabase environment setup and initial database configuration  
3. Claude Vision API testing with representative invoice samples
4. n8n workflow development and testing environment establishment

The success of this implementation will be measured by operational improvements in processing time, data accuracy, elimination of manual data entry, and user satisfaction across all stakeholder groups. The final system will provide a scalable platform for the customer's growing operational needs while maintaining the reliability and oversight required for business-critical processes.
