# Applied AI/ML OCR Approaches for Construction Industry Invoice Data Extraction - Final Test Analysis

This analysis framework focuses on understanding the experimental results from the construction invoice processing study, incorporating controlled experimental design considerations and practical system improvement insights.

The primary variable tested was the performance of open source LMM models vs open source OCR software. Additional consideration is given to the performance of Self-Attention (Llama) vs cross-attention (Pixtral) models. Different prompting strategies were incorporated for consideration.

The test data comes from a real-world general contractor in the Washington, D.C. area. This selection of the 50 images in the test set was specifically curated for their consistency in format and photo quality. Two numeric data fields were chosen for extraction mostly because ground-truth data was readily available for these fields in the contractor's digital records. While the "total cost" data field was processed as a numeric data type the "Work Order Number" data type was processed as a string allowing as it could potential include alpha-numeric characters.

Accuracy was used as the primary metric for analysis and evaluated as a binary outcome for each data field extracted from each image during the course of a single test-run. (Basically if the model returned the ground truth data 40 times in the 50 image test the accuracy would be 80%). Evaluating the work order number as a string also enabled character error rate to be calculated on the extraction of that data. Where applicable CER is used to amplify and further investigate the results of these trials. It should be noted that this measure was only performed on the work order number data field.

This analysis begins with a focus on the interactions of model type, prompt type, and field type on the accuracy of the results produced. It then looks at measures of spread in the results as indicative of model consistency and expectations of performance at scale. The analysis next focuses on the efficiency frontier presented by these models to better understand the trade-off between processing time and accuracy. Finally, a horizontal analysis of each individual image is presented to investigate how characteristics of the images themselves might be impacting model performance.

## Broad Conclusions Up Front

‚Ä¢ LMMs outperform OCR
‚Ä¢ The combination of the Llama model with step-by-step prompting yielded the best accuracy, especially with the numeric field "Total Cost"
‚Ä¢ The Pixtral model both with basic, detailed, and step-by-step prompting provided the most consistent results and the most computationally effective results
‚Ä¢ There were a few "sticky" images that seemed hard for all the models. Looking at these images it likely was a handwriting issue.

## 4. Model Consistency Study

Analysis of model consistency and performance variability. Lower ranges indicate more consistent performance across different experiments. Intended to look at spread of results between models and answer such questions as: How reliable are the results we are getting from each model? Can we expect similar results at scale?

### 4.1 Consistency over Accuracy

![Performance Range Analysis](img/analysis_10.png)

### Discussion
Llama has a higher max accuracy than Pixtral but Pixtral is more consistent. It has a smaller range of results well clustered around its mean accuracy.

### 4.2 Consistency over Character Error Rate (CER)

CER consistency analysis across model types. Lower ranges indicate more predictable character-level error rates.

![Model CER Range Analysis](img/analysis_11.png)

üìä CER RANGE ANALYSIS:

### 4.3. Range vs Accuracy and CER Scatter

This study is designed to examine the tradeoff between range in the accuracy score and the acutal accuracy score. A higher range indicates less consistency in the model where higher accuracy indicated better performance.  Therefore lower ranges are tend to indicate more predictable model output over high volumes of inputs. The visual refers to the range of scores as "Gap".  In hidnsight this wasn't the best choice for terminology

üìù NOTE: Both charts now flow from worst (lower-left) to best (upper-right):

### Discussion
There are a few images that can't be solved by any model-prompt combination. Further study could examine these images for the characteristics that are common across them. This information can inform future pre-processing efforts. Similarly, future exploration could explore the causes behind an image characteristics that are processed well on one model but not the other.

A cursory examination shows handwriting and strike-throughs as the most likely underlying cause of the "sticky" images. A more thorough investigation could help with pre-processing and flagging these images or providing updated prompting to the model to improve performance.
