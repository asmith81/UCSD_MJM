# Final Analysis Framework Feedback

## Feedback Summary

### **Areas of Agreement**
- **Overall Results Summary in Project Context**: All points agreed upon and accurate
- **Prompt Engineering Deep Dive**: All suggested areas are interesting and important for analysis
- **Field-Specific Performance Analysis**: Excellent areas to investigate in the analysis

### **Areas Requiring Modification**

#### **Cross-Model Performance Analysis**
**Original Suggestions:**
- Accuracy Stratification: Analyze performance by invoice complexity, image quality, handwriting vs. printed text
- Model Robustness: Identify which models handle edge cases better (poor image quality, unusual layouts)

**Feedback:** 
- These are interesting thoughts, but the input images were specifically groomed to provide consistent format with printed keys and handwritten values
- Best effort was made to only provide higher-quality images to reduce the impact of these variables
- These variables were intentionally controlled for in this experiment
- Re-introducing these variables would be interesting in future studies but should not be considered for current analysis
- **Note:** Need to document this experimental design choice in the analysis

**Keep:** Error Pattern Taxonomies - interesting area of focus that can lead to easy system improvements

#### **Horizontal Image Analysis**
**Feedback:** As discussed above, these would be good notes for a future study but the experiment tried to control for these variables

#### **Sections to Move Out of Analysis Notebook**
**Section 6: Production Deployment Recommendations**
- Good areas for discussion in a different part of the project
- Maybe a "next steps" or "production roadmap" 
- Don't really belong in the overall analysis of results

**Section 7: Research Contributions**
- Great discussion topics for a conclusions section
- Don't add to the analysis notebook part

**Section 8: Interactive Exploration Tools**
- Getting a little too far at this point

### **Focus Areas for Revised Framework**
Based on feedback, the analysis should focus on:
1. Overall results summary with experimental design notes
2. Error pattern taxonomies for system improvement insights
3. Prompt engineering effectiveness analysis
4. Field-specific performance deep dive
5. Cross-model comparison (noting controlled variables)
6. Character Error Rate analysis
7. Business-critical field analysis
8. Computational efficiency analysis

### **Scope Clarification**
The analysis notebook should focus on understanding the experimental results rather than production deployment or broader research implications. Those topics belong in separate deliverables focused on next steps and conclusions.
