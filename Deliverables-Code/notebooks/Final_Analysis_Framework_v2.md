## Notebook Structure and Cell Specifications

### **Section 1: Executive Summary**

#### **Experimental Design & Controlled Variables**
This analysis is based on a carefully controlled experimental design that minimized several variables to focus on core model performance differences:

**Image Quality Control**: All input images were specifically groomed to provide consistent format and quality. Best effort was made to provide only higher-quality images to reduce the impact of image quality variables on model performance.

**Content Standardization**: Images were curated to maintain consistent format with printed keys (field labels) and handwritten values (data entries). This standardization allows for cleaner comparison of model capabilities without confounding variables.

**Controlled Variables**: The following factors were intentionally controlled and should not be considered as analysis variables in this study:
- Image resolution and clarity
- Lighting conditions and contrast
- Invoice layout complexity
- Handwriting vs. printed text variations (beyond the standard printed keys/handwritten values format)

**Design Rationale**: These controls enable focused analysis of model architecture differences and prompt engineering effectiveness without confounding from image quality or format variations. Future studies could systematically reintroduce these variables to understand their impact on model performance.
